description: Git worktree-based workflow for parallel development with shared context. Incremental commits after logical units, feature branches with nested issue branches, squash-merge to main. Use when creating/managing worktrees, working on parallel features, committing code, creating branches, or handling branch cleanup.

# Git Workflow

Use incremental commits and feature branch workflow for all development work. Make commits frequently as logical units complete, and organize work using feature branches with nested issue branches.

## Commit Workflow

Make incremental commits as you work. Don't wait until everything is done.

### Core Principle: Every Commit Must Leave the Program in a Good State

**Required for every commit:**
- Tests pass
- No broken functionality
- Code runs without errors

A commit should represent a complete, working increment of functionality - however small.

### When to Commit

**Commit after each logical unit of work is complete and working.**

Don't batch up multiple changes before committing. Each commit should be a self-contained change that could be understood in isolation.

#### Example: Display System Feature

Instead of one large commit at the end:

```
Commit 1: Add IDisplay interface
Commit 2: Add display dependencies to package.json
Commit 3: Implement TerminalDisplay class
Commit 4: Refactor command to inject display
```

Each commit is:
- A complete unit of work
- Independently understandable
- In a working state (tests pass, code runs)

### Push Early, Push Often

- Push to remote ASAP after commits
- Don't let work sit locally
- Makes work visible and creates backups
- Enables collaboration and early feedback

### Commit Messages

**Good commit messages:**
- Use clear, descriptive language
- Focus on "what" and "why" rather than just "how"
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature")
- Follow project conventions if they exist

**Examples:**
- "Add IDisplay interface for terminal output abstraction"
- "Implement incremental commit workflow in git-commit skill"
- "Fix type validation in JSDoc plugin"

### Remember: Squash and Merge Cleans Up Main

Feature branches show granular work with many small commits. When you squash and merge to main, the history is clean and focused. This means:

- **On feature branches**: Commit frequently, keep commits small and focused
- **On main**: Each merge represents a complete feature or fix
- You get the best of both worlds: detailed history during development, clean history in main

### What This Is Not

This is not:
- Committing broken code ("I'll fix it in the next commit")
- Committing work-in-progress that doesn't run
- Holding off on commits until a feature is "perfect"
- Making commits so large they include multiple unrelated changes

## Worktree-Based Development (DocImp Default)

This project uses **git worktrees** for all development. Each feature or issue gets its own worktree (separate working directory) with its own branch.

### Why Worktrees

- **Parallel development**: Work on multiple features simultaneously in separate Claude Code instances
- **Shared context**: Code reviews, planning docs, and runbooks accessible across all worktrees
- **Clean isolation**: Each worktree has its own branch and working directory
- **No context switching**: No need to stash changes when switching between features

### Creating a New Worktree

**Default workflow:** Use the helper script for all new features/issues:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/docimp
scripts/create-worktree.sh <worktree-name> <branch-name>

# Example for new feature:
scripts/create-worktree.sh issue-260 issue-260-display-consistency
```

The script automatically:
- Ensures main is up-to-date
- Creates worktree in `../.docimp-wt/<worktree-name>/`
- Creates branch `<branch-name>`
- Sets up all necessary symlinks (CLAUDE.md, .planning, .scratch, .claude/skills, .claude/settings.local.json)

### Branch Naming

- Use descriptive names that explain the work
- Include issue number for traceability
- **Good**: `issue-260-display-consistency`, `issue-221-improve-styleguides`
- **Bad**: `feature-1`, `my-branch`, `updates`

### Nested Issue Branches

When you discover a sub-issue while working on a feature:

1. **Create a new worktree from the feature branch** (not main):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/.docimp-wt/issue-260
   scripts/create-worktree.sh issue-260-fix-typo issue-260-fix-typo
   # Note: Script needs to be enhanced to support branching from non-main
   ```

2. **Address the sub-issue** using frequent commits

3. **Open a PR back to the feature branch** (not main)
   - Keeps work organized
   - Allows independent review of fixes
   - Maintains clear history

4. **Merge to feature branch**, then continue feature work in original worktree

### Merging to Main

When the feature is complete:

1. **From the worktree**, push your branch:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/.docimp-wt/issue-260
   git push -u origin issue-260-display-consistency
   ```

2. **Open a PR** to `main` using GitHub CLI or web interface:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "Fix progress display consistency" --body "Fixes #260..."
   ```

3. **After merge**, clean up:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/docimp  # Return to main repo
   git checkout main && git pull        # Update main
   git worktree remove ../.docimp-wt/issue-260  # Remove worktree
   git branch -d issue-260-display-consistency  # Delete local branch
   # Remote branch kept for history
   ```

Use **squash and merge** to keep main history clean while preserving detailed development history on the feature branch.

### Why Worktrees Work Better

**vs. Traditional Branching:**
- No need to stash/commit incomplete work when switching tasks
- Each worktree has independent state (no conflicts)
- Shared context files (code reviews, planning) accessible everywhere
- Can run tests in one worktree while coding in another
- Can run multiple instances of Claude Code in separate worktrees

**Squash and merge:**
- Main branch gets clean, focused history
- Feature branches preserve detailed development history
- Best of both worlds: detail during development, clarity in main

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Start new feature/issue (DEFAULT WORKFLOW)
cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/docimp
scripts/create-worktree.sh issue-260 issue-260-display-consistency
cd ../.docimp-wt/issue-260

# After completing a logical unit of work:
git add <files>
git commit -m "Clear, descriptive message"
git push

# Feature complete?
gh pr create --title "..." --body "Fixes #260..."

# After PR merged:
cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/docimp
git checkout main && git pull
git worktree remove ../.docimp-wt/issue-260 && git branch -d issue-260-display-consistency

# Check all worktrees:
git worktree list
```

The sections above cover the standard workflow. This section provides details about the worktree infrastructure for troubleshooting or manual setup.

### Directory Structure

```
~/Code/polygot/
├── docimp/                    # Main repo (main branch)
├── .docimp-wt/               # Hidden worktrees directory
│   ├── issue-221/            # Worktree branches
│   └── issue-243/
└── .docimp-shared/           # Shared gitignored files
    ├── CLAUDE.md
    ├── CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
    ├── .planning/
    ├── .scratch/             # Code reviews, runbooks
    └── .claude/
        ├── skills/           # Shared skills
        └── settings.local.json  # Shared local settings
```

### Helper Script Details

The `scripts/create-worktree.sh` script automates worktree creation:

**What it does:**
- Ensures you're on main and up-to-date
- Creates the `../.docimp-wt/` directory if needed
- Creates the new worktree with the specified branch
- Creates all 6 necessary symlinks:
  - `CLAUDE.md` → `../../.docimp-shared/CLAUDE.md`
  - `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` → `../../.docimp-shared/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md`
  - `.planning` → `../../.docimp-shared/.planning`
  - `.scratch` → `../../.docimp-shared/.scratch`
  - `.claude/skills` → `../../../.docimp-shared/.claude/skills`
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` → `../../../.docimp-shared/.claude/settings.local.json`
- Provides confirmation with next steps

### Manual Worktree Creation (Troubleshooting Only)

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/docimp
git checkout main && git pull
mkdir -p ../.docimp-wt  # First time only
git worktree add ../.docimp-wt/issue-XXX -b issue-XXX-description

# Create symlinks in new worktree
cd ../.docimp-wt/issue-XXX
ln -s ../../.docimp-shared/CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md
ln -s ../../.docimp-shared/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
ln -s ../../.docimp-shared/.planning .planning
ln -s ../../.docimp-shared/.scratch .scratch
mkdir -p .claude
ln -s ../../../.docimp-shared/.claude/skills .claude/skills
ln -s ../../../.docimp-shared/.claude/settings.local.json .claude/settings.local.json
```

### Initial Shared Directory Setup (One-Time)

If setting up shared files for the first time:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/docimp

# Create shared directory
mkdir -p ../.docimp-shared/.planning ../.docimp-shared/.scratch

# Move existing files to shared location
mv CLAUDE.md ../.docimp-shared/ 2>/dev/null || true
mv CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md ../.docimp-shared/ 2>/dev/null || true
mv .planning/* ../.docimp-shared/.planning/ 2>/dev/null || true
mv .scratch/* ../.docimp-shared/.scratch/ 2>/dev/null || true
rmdir .planning .scratch 2>/dev/null || true

# Create symlinks in main repo
ln -s ../.docimp-shared/CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md
ln -s ../.docimp-shared/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
ln -s ../.docimp-shared/.planning .planning
ln -s ../.docimp-shared/.scratch .scratch
```

### Benefits

- **Parallel development**: Work on multiple issues simultaneously in separate Claude Code instances
- **Shared context**: Code reviews, runbooks, and planning docs accessible across all worktrees
- **Clean isolation**: Each worktree has its own branch and working directory
- **Easy switching**: Open different worktrees in different windows/instances

### Parallel Development Example

Work on two independent issues simultaneously:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Create and work on Issue #221
cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/docimp
scripts/create-worktree.sh issue-221 issue-221-styleguides
cd ../.docimp-wt/issue-221
# Open in Claude Code instance 1

# Terminal 2: Create and work on Issue #243
cd ~/Documents/Code/Polygot/docimp
scripts/create-worktree.sh issue-243 issue-243-api-timeout
cd ../.docimp-wt/issue-243
# Open in Claude Code instance 2

# Both worktrees have access to:
# - Shared code reviews in .scratch/
# - Shared planning docs in .planning/
# - Same project-specific skills in .claude/skills/
# - Same local settings in .claude/settings.local.json
```

**Check all active worktrees:**

```bash
git worktree list
```
