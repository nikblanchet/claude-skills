# Code Review Dimensions - Deep Dive

This document provides detailed guidance on each of the 11 dimensions to examine during code reviews.

## 1. Functional Completeness

**CRITICAL: Check this FIRST before diving into code quality details.**

### What to Verify

- Does the PR implement ALL requirements from the linked issue(s)?
- Does it follow the design decisions and implementation plan from the issue?
- Are all acceptance criteria met?
- Does the implementation actually work correctly for the intended use cases?
- Are there missing features or incomplete implementations?
- Does it solve the problem it claims to solve?
- If the issue has a checklist, are all items completed?

### How to Verify

- Read the linked issue(s) thoroughly before reviewing code
- Check issue description for requirements and acceptance criteria
- Look for implementation plans or design decisions in issue comments
- Trace through the code to verify each requirement is actually implemented
- Consider edge cases mentioned in the issue
- Verify test cases cover the use cases from the issue

### Common Problems

- PR claims to implement feature X but only implements 70% of it
- Design decisions from issue discussion were ignored
- Acceptance criteria not met (e.g., "must support async operations" but only sync implemented)
- Implementation doesn't match the agreed-upon approach from issue discussion
- Missing validation or error handling specified in requirements

### Example Finding

**Blocker: Missing Required Feature from Issue Requirements**
- Issue #121 requires three features: (1) Basic validation (IMPLEMENTED), (2) Async validation support (MISSING), (3) Custom error messages (MISSING)
- Only 1 of 3 requirements is implemented
- Acceptance criteria states "Must support async validators for API calls" - not present

## 2. Code Quality and Development Preferences

### What to Examine

- Uses modern language features appropriately?
- Follows project conventions and style guides?
- Clear, descriptive naming?
- Appropriate use of comments and inline documentation?
- Avoids anti-patterns?

### Good Signs

- Variable names explain intent
- Functions do one thing
- Consistent with rest of codebase
- Uses language idioms appropriately
- Comments explain "why" not "what"

### Red Flags

- Magic numbers without explanation
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Functions doing multiple unrelated things
- Copy-pasted code blocks
- Comments contradicting code

## 3. Code Architecture

### What to Examine

- Follows established architectural patterns?
- Proper separation of concerns?
- Dependency injection used appropriately?
- Interfaces and abstractions at correct level?
- Module boundaries respected?

### Good Signs

- Dependencies injected through constructors
- Clear interfaces between modules
- Business logic separated from infrastructure
- Consistent with architectural decisions in rest of codebase
- Single Responsibility Principle followed

### Red Flags

- Direct instantiation instead of injection
- Mixing business logic with infrastructure code
- Circular dependencies
- Tight coupling between unrelated modules
- Violating established abstractions

## 4. Test Coverage

### What to Examine

- Adequate unit test coverage?
- Integration tests for component interactions?
- Edge cases tested?
- Error conditions tested?
- Tests are maintainable and clear?
- Included in end-to-end testing?

### Good Signs

- Tests cover both success and failure paths
- Edge cases explicitly tested
- Test names clearly describe what they verify
- Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)
- Mocking used appropriately

### Red Flags

- No tests for new functionality
- Only happy path tested
- Tests depend on external services
- Tests are fragile (break with minor changes)
- Test logic is complex and hard to understand

## 5. Documentation Quality

### What to Examine

- Public APIs documented?
- Complex logic explained?
- Docstrings/JSDoc accurate and complete?
- Examples provided where helpful?
- README or other docs updated if needed?

### Good Signs

- All public methods have docstrings
- Complex algorithms explained
- Examples for non-obvious usage
- Parameter types and return values documented
- Known limitations documented

### Red Flags

- Public APIs undocumented
- Docstrings don't match implementation
- Complex logic with no explanation
- README out of date
- Examples that don't work

## 6. Edge Cases

### What to Examine

- Null/undefined handling?
- Empty collections handled?
- Boundary conditions tested?
- Concurrent access considered?
- Resource limits considered?

### Common Edge Cases to Check

**Data boundaries:**
- Empty strings, null, undefined
- Empty arrays/lists
- Zero values
- Maximum values (integer overflow?)
- Negative values where not expected

**Concurrent access:**
- Race conditions
- Deadlocks
- Resource contention

**Resource limits:**
- Maximum file size
- Memory constraints
- Network timeouts
- Rate limits

### Example Finding

**Critical: Missing null handling**
- Function assumes input is never null
- Will crash if called with null value
- Should validate input or document precondition

## 7. Error Handling

### What to Examine

- Errors caught and handled appropriately?
- Error messages clear and actionable?
- Graceful degradation where possible?
- Logging sufficient for debugging?
- Resources cleaned up on error paths?

### Good Signs

- Specific exception types caught
- Error messages explain what went wrong and how to fix
- Resources (files, connections, locks) released in finally blocks
- Errors logged with context
- Transient errors retried appropriately

### Red Flags

- Catching generic exceptions and swallowing them
- Error messages like "Error occurred"
- Resource leaks on error paths
- No logging of errors
- Silent failures

## 8. Performance & Scalability

### What to Examine

- Algorithm complexity appropriate?
- Database queries efficient?
- Caching used where beneficial?
- Memory usage reasonable?
- Will this scale with growth?

### Common Performance Issues

**Algorithmic:**
- O(nÂ²) algorithm where O(n) possible
- Repeated work that could be cached
- Inefficient data structures

**Database:**
- N+1 query problems
- Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
- Loading entire dataset when pagination possible

**Memory:**
- Loading large files entirely into memory
- Memory leaks
- Unbounded caches

### When to Raise

- **Blocker:** Obvious performance issue that makes feature unusable
- **Critical:** Significant regression from previous implementation
- **Important:** Scalability concern that will become problem with growth
- **Enhancement:** Optimization that would be nice but not necessary

## 9. Maintainability & Future-Proofing

### What to Examine

- Code readable and understandable?
- Duplication minimized?
- Easy to modify without breaking?
- Dependencies managed well?
- Migration path for breaking changes?

### Good Signs

- Self-documenting code
- DRY principle followed
- Loose coupling
- Good test coverage makes refactoring safe
- Clear extension points

### Red Flags

- Spaghetti code
- Copy-paste duplication
- Tight coupling
- Hard-coded values that should be configurable
- Breaking changes without migration path

## 10. Security & Safety

### What to Examine

- Input validation and sanitization?
- SQL injection protection?
- XSS protection?
- Authentication/authorization correct?
- Secrets not hardcoded or committed?
- Rate limiting where needed?

### Common Security Issues

**Injection attacks:**
- SQL injection from string concatenation
- Command injection from unvalidated input
- XSS from unsanitized user content

**Authentication/Authorization:**
- Missing authentication checks
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Session management issues

**Data exposure:**
- Secrets in code or logs
- Sensitive data in error messages
- Excessive permissions granted

### When to Raise

**Always Blocker** - Security vulnerabilities must be fixed before merge

## 11. Cross-Cutting Concerns

**These vary by project but require comparing code under review with other stable code in the system.**

### Common Cross-Cutting Concerns

#### Polyglot Interactions
**In multi-language systems:**
- Language boundaries handled correctly?
- Data serialization/deserialization safe?
- Type safety maintained across language boundaries?
- Example: Python processing JavaScript config files correctly?
- Example: TypeScript injecting dependencies into Python correctly?

#### Pattern Consistency
**Comparing with existing code:**
- Follows established patterns in the codebase?
- If deviates, is there clear justification?
- Example: Other modules use functional approach, but this uses OOP - why?
- Example: Other parsers follow specific abstraction pattern - does this one?

#### Data Structure Consistency
- Uses established data models?
- Transformations between representations consistent?
- Naming conventions match related modules?

#### API Design Consistency
- Error handling consistent with other APIs?
- Parameter ordering and naming consistent?
- Return types follow project conventions?

### How to Identify

1. Find similar functionality in the codebase
2. Compare patterns and approaches
3. Note deviations
4. Determine if deviation is justified or problematic

### Example Finding

**Blocker: Inconsistent Parser Pattern**
- Other parsers (PythonParser, TypeScriptParser) inherit from BaseParser and implement parse_file()
- This parser doesn't follow that pattern
- Makes it inconsistent with established architecture
- Breaks expectation set by other parsers
